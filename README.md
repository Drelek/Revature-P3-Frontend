## Project Description

The Serverless Training planner is a serverless mobile app that Revature managers can use to look at important information regarding clientele demands and batch output for the company. This service visualizes all current batches planned along with any associated information. It also visualizes that batch output alongside the client demand for associates. Managers may input information for clients, their demands, and batches which consist of a curriculum composed of skills, the number of associates, a trainer, and the dates for the batch. This service helps ease the management of supply and demand for the company and is an organizational aid.
